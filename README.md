## Project Status

Lynavo Drive is implemented and open for community source builds and
contributions. This repository provides one public local source-build and
package-verification path; it does not publish official signed installers,
mobile store builds, auto-updates, or hosted services.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Automatic incremental media sync**: Scans the mobile photo library and
  queues unsynced photos and videos without manual file selection.
- **Local discovery and pairing**: Finds desktops through mDNS on the same LAN,
  then pairs with a QR code or six-digit pairing code.
- **Resumable serial transfers**: Uploads one file per phone at a time and
  continues unfinished queue items after foreground LAN reconnection.
- **Read-only queue and history**: Shows transfer progress, completed files, and
  completion-day statistics without delete, skip, or reorder controls.
- **Shared-file access**: Lets mobile users browse and download files exposed by
  the desktop's local shared directories. This is separate from automatic media
  upload.
- **Local diagnostics**: Exports desktop and mobile diagnostics without relying
  on a hosted diagnostics service.

## 🛡️ OSS Boundaries

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Local-LAN Open-Source Core**
>
> - Foreground automatic sync works without sign-in or an account service.
> - The upload set comes only from the mobile photo-library scan and local
>   pending queue; there is no manual file-selection fallback.
> - The queue is read-only, and each phone uploads one file at a time.
> - Missing non-OSS modules or account-service state do not block foreground LAN
>   pairing and sync.

> [!WARNING]
> **Not Included In This Repository**
>
> - Remote access, cloud relay, tunnel credentials, official accounts, and silent
>   background continuation are unavailable and remain disabled.
> - Official signing, notarization, mobile store distribution, package upload,
>   and auto-update infrastructure are not provided.
> - The source package does not redistribute Apple Bonjour for Windows. It uses
>   a locally installed/configured Bonjour runtime when available, otherwise the
>   zeroconf-compatible fallback.
> - Linux remains a local build and package-verification target, not a supported
>   desktop user surface.

## 🚀 Developer Quick Start

This is a contributor workflow, not an end-user installer. See the
[release playbook](./docs/release/release-playbook.md) for local package builds
and platform-specific verification.

```bash
# 1. Enable the repository's pinned pnpm version and install dependencies
corepack enable
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

# 2. Build shared packages
pnpm --filter @lynavo-drive/contracts build
pnpm --filter @lynavo-drive/design-tokens build

# 3. Start desktop development mode
pnpm dev:desktop
```

The Electron window opens automatically, and the desktop app starts the sidecar.

To run a mobile client, keep the desktop running and use another terminal:

```bash
# Start Metro
pnpm dev:mobile

# Then launch one platform from another terminal
pnpm --filter @lynavo-drive/mobile ios
# or
pnpm dev:mobile:android
```

Platform prerequisites still apply: iOS requires macOS, Xcode, and CocoaPods;
Android requires Android Studio plus the Android SDK/NDK.

Pair the applications:

1. Keep the phone and desktop on the same LAN.
2. Open Lynavo Drive on the desktop and set or view the six-digit pairing code.
3. On mobile, discover the desktop and scan its QR code or enter the pairing
   code.
4. Keep the mobile app in the foreground for OSS automatic LAN sync.

## ❓ FAQs & Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>🔍 View Troubleshooting Guide & Common FAQs</summary>

### 1. The mobile app cannot find my desktop client (mDNS discovery failure)

- **Check Network**: Ensure both mobile and desktop are on the same local LAN.
- **Windows Firewall**: Verify that Windows Defender Firewall allows incoming traffic for ports `39593` (TCP/LMUP file transport) and `39594` (HTTP API).
- **Bonjour Runtime**: The OSS build doesn't redistribute Apple Bonjour. Ensure Bonjour is installed on Windows, or rely on the zeroconf-compatible fallback.

### 2. Why are some of my iCloud photos stuck/not transferring?

- Photos marked with `iCloud` must be exported from the Apple Photos cloud repository before transfer.
- While in `cloud_downloading` or `preparing` states, the phone is downloading the high-res original asset to local storage. Transfer begins automatically once complete.

### 3. Can I manually select which photos/videos to sync?

- No. Automatic upload is driven by the mobile photo-library scan and strictly
  read-only pending queue. Checkbox picking is not part of the OSS workflow.

### 4. What happens when the desktop sleeps or connection drops?

- LAN transfers will interrupt. With the mobile app in the foreground, the
  unfinished queue continues after the desktop wakes and LAN connectivity is
  restored.
- The OSS runtime does not provide silent background continuation.
- Enable _"Prevent computer from sleeping while syncing"_ in the desktop app settings for uninterrupted transfers.

## 📦 OSS Build & Package Verification

This OSS repository keeps contributor-local source-build paths and
GitHub-hosted, secret-free unsigned build/package verification. Hosted outputs
are verification artifacts, not official signed distributions. Linux remains
local verification only and is not a supported desktop user surface.

<details>
<summary>🔬 View Verification & Build Pipelines</summary>

```bash
# Inspect the local build / package commands that would run
pnpm release --profile review --targets ios,android,mac,win,linux --dry-run

# Local iOS / Android Debug / Desktop build verification
pnpm build:mobile
pnpm build:mobile:ios:release
pnpm build:mobile:android
pnpm package:desktop

# Android Release source-build verification
pnpm release --profile review --targets android --dry-run
pnpm release --profile review --targets android

# Local desktop platform package
pnpm package:desktop

# Linux package verification (Linux host, one arch per run)
pnpm --filter @lynavo-drive/desktop package:linux -- --arch=x64
pnpm --filter @lynavo-drive/desktop package:linux -- --arch=arm64
```

</details>

`release` profiles only inject `LYNAVO_RELEASE_CHANNEL` and local build
configuration, and only select local build/package commands.

GitHub-hosted workflows may invoke these commands using public source and no
repository secrets. Third-party or external build services, code signing,
notarization, store upload, auto-update, and private distribution infrastructure
remain outside this OSS baseline.

The `OSS Draft Release` workflow accepts stable tags matching `vX.Y.Z`, rebuilds
the complete verification set from that tagged commit, and creates or updates a
draft GitHub Release. Manual dispatch is build-only. Release files are unsigned
OSS build-verification outputs and include SHA-256 checksums; see the
[release playbook](./docs/release/release-playbook.md) for the exact asset list,
warnings, and maintainer procedure.

## 🎯 Development Baseline

- Shared types, constants, event names, and port definitions come from
  `@lynavo-drive/contracts`.
- The renderer does not access the sidecar, filesystem, or SQLite directly; all
  access goes through the preload bridge / main process.
- The queue stays read-only. The UI cannot delete, reorder, or skip items.
- A given phone uploads only one file at a time.
- Guest/local foreground LAN sync is fail-open; remote access and background
  continuation fail closed.
