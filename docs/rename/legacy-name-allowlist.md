# Legacy Name Allowlist

This file tracks temporary compatibility uses of legacy product names during the Lynavo Drive rename.

The scanner is advisory in Task 0. Later rename tasks should remove broad hits and make the check CI-blocking.

## Scanner

Run:

```bash
pnpm verify:legacy-names
```

The scanner searches for:

- `Vivi Drop`
- `vividrop`
- `SyncFlow`
- `syncflow`
- `SYNCFLOW`
- `VIVIDROP`
- `@syncflow`

It scans hidden files and directories, while explicitly skipping generated build artifacts such as `node_modules`, `dist`, `build`, `out`, `release`, coverage output, `.git`, and `.turbo`.

## Allowed Compatibility Paths

## Temporary Historical-Doc Exceptions

The following exact `docs/superpowers` paths are temporarily allowlisted because they are historical implementation plans and specs written before the rename. The exception is intentionally exact rather than directory-wide so new rename work remains visible to the advisory scanner.

`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-29-lynavo-drive-global-only-oss.md` is not allowlisted by this historical-doc exception.
