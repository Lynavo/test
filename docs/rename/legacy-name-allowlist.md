# Legacy Name Allowlist

This file tracks temporary compatibility uses of legacy product names during the Lynavo Drive rename.

The strict scanner is now intended to be CI-blocking: every remaining legacy hit must either be removed or match a narrow compatibility rationale in `scripts/verify-legacy-name-allowlist.mjs`.

## Scanner

Run:

```bash
pnpm verify:legacy-names
```

The scanner searches for:

- `Vivi Drop`
- `vividrop`
- `SyncFlow`
- `syncflow`
- `SYNCFLOW`
- `VIVIDROP`
- `@syncflow`

It scans hidden files and directories, while explicitly skipping generated build artifacts such as `node_modules`, `dist`, `build`, `out`, `release`, coverage output, `.git`, and `.turbo`.

## Allowed Compatibility Paths

## Temporary Historical-Doc Exceptions

The following exact `docs/superpowers` paths are temporarily allowlisted because they are historical implementation plans and specs written before the rename. The exception is intentionally exact rather than directory-wide so new rename work remains visible to the advisory scanner.

`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-29-lynavo-drive-global-only-oss.md` is allowlisted as the current rename source plan and remains exact-path scoped.

Any other hit is intentionally reported as unallowlisted until a later rename task removes it or adds a narrower compatibility rationale.
