# Account And Commercial Dependency Inventory

Status: collected on 2026-07-01 for the global-only community OSS baseline.

This inventory separates local-first LAN functionality from official commercial
features. It is a planning artifact: it does not authorize deleting LAN sync,
paired-device HMAC access, pending queue behavior, or local shared-directory
browsing.

## Classification

| Class                    | Meaning                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Keep baseline            | Required for community OSS local LAN behavior.                                         |
| Keep fail-closed stub    | Compatibility surface may stay, but must never enable paid behavior in OSS.            |
| Move to official overlay | Positive commercial behavior should live outside the OSS baseline.                     |
| Moved out of OSS         | Commercial runtime surface has been removed from the OSS baseline in the current tree. |
| Delete or rename         | Remove unused commercial residue or rename misleading local-LAN names.                 |
| Harden                   | Not a commercial feature by itself, but should be tightened before public OSS release. |

## Current Conclusions

1. Foreground local LAN sync is mostly fail-open already. Desktop has no auth
   shell, mobile routes guests into `LanSyncStack`, and sidecar TCP sync gates on
   pairing/HMAC rather than account state.
2. `@lynavo-drive/contracts` now exposes only the community foreground LAN
   entitlement. Commercial background and tunnel entitlement fields were removed
   from the OSS contract surface.
3. Mobile native background continuation runtime and native shared-files tunnel
   route skeletons have been removed from the OSS baseline. The largest
   remaining mobile residue is legacy auth/account UI, RemoteAccess naming for
   LAN browsing, and manual file-selection upload surfaces.
4. "RemoteAccess" often means LAN personal-directory browsing in current mobile
   and desktop UI. Do not delete it as paid tunnel code without first splitting
   the naming and route policy.
5. Sidecar and desktop no longer expose commercial credential sync, tunnel
   health, remote-access settings, or account/tunnel/wake proxy HTTP endpoints in
   the OSS tree. Positive commercial implementations belong outside this
   baseline.

| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Product distribution    | `apps/desktop/src/shared/product.ts:6` sets `PRODUCT_DISTRIBUTION = 'community'`.                                                                                       | Keep baseline           | Keep as OSS identity guard.                                               |
| Auth IPC/preload        | `apps/desktop/src/main/ipc-handlers.ts:30`, `apps/desktop/src/preload/index.ts:58`; guard tests in `ipc-handlers.test.ts:261` and `preload/__tests__/index.test.ts:71`. | Keep baseline           | Preserve guard tests that no auth/session/subscription bridge is exposed. |
| Sidecar commercial sync | `apps/desktop/src/main/sidecar-client.ts` has no credential-sync helper; desktop tests assert the OSS client does not expose it.                                        | Moved out of OSS        | Keep removed; official overlays must own positive credential sync.        |
| Remote sidecar plumbing | `apps/desktop/src/main/sidecar-client.ts` now targets the local sidecar base and no longer carries remote request helpers.                                              | Moved out of OSS        | Keep local-only dispatch in OSS.                                          |
| Tunnel health read      | Desktop sidecar health no longer models a `tunnel` object.                                                                                                              | Moved out of OSS        | Keep health local-only.                                                   |
| Settings store default  | Renderer initial settings no longer default `remoteAccessEnabled`.                                                                                                      | Moved out of OSS        | Keep absent; do not reintroduce a remote access toggle in OSS settings.   |
| Misleading UI keys      | Desktop dashboard/setup copy now uses local-file-access keys instead of `remoteAccess*` for LAN file access.                                                            | Moved out of OSS        | Continue removing remaining unused auth copy.                             |
| Unused auth copy        | `apps/desktop/src/renderer/i18n/locales/en/common.json:84` and zh locale peers keep `authPage` copy with no non-locale references.                                      | Delete or rename        | Remove unused auth locale blocks.                                         |
| Support/update backend  | `apps/desktop/src/main/diagnostics.ts:473` and `:712` can call official support/update APIs.                                                                            | Keep baseline with note | Treat as support service dependency, not account/tunnel sync.             |
| Local pairing/resources | Dashboard QR pairing, IPC local sidecar, received library and shared resources are local LAN features.                                                                  | Keep baseline           | Do not remove; these are not manual mobile upload alternatives.           |

| Auth state shell              | `apps/mobile/src/stores/auth-store.tsx:23`, `:57`, `:115`, `:146`, `:240`.                                                 | Keep fail-closed stub    | Keep token cleanup now; shrink legacy `UserProfile`/`SubscriptionInfo` after callers are removed.                 |
| Broad feature gate            | `apps/mobile/src/stores/auth-store.tsx:371`; `SyncActivityScreen.tsx:654` consumes it.                                     | Delete or rename         | Remove `isFeatureAccessAllowed` and the `useAuth` dependency from sync activity; it is a dead compatibility gate. |
| API bearer auth               | `apps/mobile/src/services/api.ts:94` returns no auth headers; `:187` rejects `/auth/refresh`.                              | Keep fail-closed stub    | Keep until all official account API callers are absent; then simplify.                                            |
| Auth service bridge           | `apps/mobile/src/services/auth-service.ts:34` documents official helpers absent.                                           | Keep fail-closed stub    | Remove only after `api.ts` no longer needs clear-auth callbacks.                                                  |
| App config                    | `apps/mobile/src/services/app-config-service.ts` no longer calls paid native feature toggles.                              | Keep fail-closed stub    | Keep OSS no-op; official overlay must own positive native config.                                                 |
| Native tunnel bridge          | `apps/mobile/src/services/SyncEngineModule.ts` no longer exports a tunnel credential bridge; native bridges were removed.  | Moved out of OSS         | Keep removed; official overlays must own any positive tunnel credential path.                                     |
| Legacy owner marker           | `apps/mobile/src/services/SyncEngineModule.ts:712`, `:741`.                                                                | Delete or rename         | Remove if no OSS caller needs account-owner mismatch repair.                                                      |
| RemoteAccess naming           | `apps/mobile/src/services/desktop-local-service.ts:689`, `:1112`; `RemoteAccessGlobalScreen.tsx` uses personal LAN browse. | Delete or rename         | Keep LAN behavior, rename from remote access to personal/local computer browsing.                                 |
| Subscription locale namespace | `apps/mobile/src/i18n/resources.ts:12`, `OpenSourceInfoScreen.tsx:44`, `subscription.json:1`.                              | Delete or rename         | Rename `subscription` namespace to OSS/community info after UI impact is scoped.                                  |
| Social login residue          | `AppleAuthModule.swift` rejects login; Google Sign-In dependency and URL scheme remain but JS is unused.                   | Move to official overlay | Remove from OSS native/deps or keep only explicit unsupported stubs.                                              |

| iOS background upload runtime | Background URLSession/BGTask registration, upload service code, HTTP reset state machine, UploadStore HTTP/background metadata, and the old background upload plan were removed; only short UIKit transition tasks remain. | Moved out of OSS | Keep OSS foreground-only; official overlays must own paid background upload runtime.                       |
| Android background service    | Android foreground-service class, manifest service declaration and notification resources were removed.                                                                                                                    | Moved out of OSS | Keep removed; official overlays must own paid background continuation.                                     |

## Recommended Follow-up Order

1. Mobile auth cleanup: remove `isFeatureAccessAllowed` and sync activity auth
   dependency, then shrink legacy auth store and owner-user-id bridges.
2. Naming cleanup: split LAN personal-directory browsing from paid remote
   tunnel by renaming `RemoteAccess*` services/screens/copy to local computer or
   shared-files terminology.
3. Manual upload cleanup: remove document picker/manual-selection upload paths
   so the true upload set only comes from the mobile pending queue.
4. Sidecar HTTP hardening: add HMAC/local-only protection to mobile resource and
   presence routes, while keeping `/personal/*` as paired-device local browsing.
