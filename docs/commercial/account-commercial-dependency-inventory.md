# Account And Commercial Dependency Inventory

Status: refreshed on 2026-07-02 for the global-only community OSS baseline.

This inventory separates local-first LAN functionality from official commercial
features. It is a planning artifact: it does not authorize deleting LAN sync,
paired-device HMAC access, pending queue behavior, or local shared-directory
browsing.

## Classification

| Class                    | Meaning                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Keep baseline            | Required for community OSS local LAN behavior.                                         |
| Keep fail-closed stub    | Compatibility surface may stay, but must never enable paid behavior in OSS.            |
| Move to official overlay | Positive commercial behavior should live outside the OSS baseline.                     |
| Moved out of OSS         | Commercial runtime surface has been removed from the OSS baseline in the current tree. |
| Delete or rename         | Remove unused commercial residue or rename misleading local-LAN names.                 |
| Harden                   | Not a commercial feature by itself, but should be tightened before public OSS release. |

## Current Conclusions

1. Foreground local LAN sync is mostly fail-open already. Desktop has no auth
   shell, mobile routes guests into `LanSyncStack`, and sidecar TCP sync gates on
   pairing/HMAC rather than account state.
2. `@lynavo-drive/contracts` no longer exposes Drive entitlement/source
   resolver types. Commercial background, tunnel and paid-source metadata were
   removed from the OSS contract surface.
3. Mobile native background continuation runtime, native shared-files tunnel
   route skeletons, mobile `RemoteAccess*` naming for LAN personal-directory
   browsing, and manual file-selection upload surfaces have been removed from
   the OSS baseline. Remaining mobile residue is mainly negative assertion tests
   that guard removed commercial/manual APIs.
4. Mobile LAN personal-directory browsing is now named `LocalComputer*` /
   `GlobalLocalComputer*` in JS/UI. Native shared-files policy may still
   recognize historical wire-level disabled messages for version compatibility;
   do not treat that compatibility text as a commercial capability.
5. Sidecar and desktop no longer expose commercial credential sync, tunnel
   health, remote-access settings, or account/tunnel/wake proxy HTTP endpoints in
   the OSS tree. Positive commercial implementations belong outside this
   baseline.

| Product distribution    | `apps/desktop/src/shared/product.ts:6` sets `PRODUCT_DISTRIBUTION = 'community'`.                                                                                                      | Keep baseline    | Keep as OSS identity guard.                                                                                      |
| Auth IPC/preload        | `apps/desktop/src/main/ipc-handlers.ts:30`, `apps/desktop/src/preload/index.ts:58`; guard tests in `ipc-handlers.test.ts:261` and `preload/__tests__/index.test.ts:71`.                | Keep baseline    | Preserve guard tests that no auth/session/subscription bridge is exposed.                                        |
| Sidecar commercial sync | `apps/desktop/src/main/sidecar-client.ts` has no credential-sync helper; desktop tests assert the OSS client does not expose it.                                                       | Moved out of OSS | Keep removed; official overlays must own positive credential sync.                                               |
| Remote sidecar plumbing | `apps/desktop/src/main/sidecar-client.ts` now targets the local sidecar base and no longer carries remote request helpers.                                                             | Moved out of OSS | Keep local-only dispatch in OSS.                                                                                 |
| Tunnel health read      | Desktop sidecar health no longer models a `tunnel` object.                                                                                                                             | Moved out of OSS | Keep health local-only.                                                                                          |
| Settings store default  | Renderer initial settings no longer default `remoteAccessEnabled`.                                                                                                                     | Moved out of OSS | Keep absent; do not reintroduce a remote access toggle in OSS settings.                                          |
| Misleading UI keys      | Desktop dashboard/setup copy now uses local-file-access keys instead of `remoteAccess*` for LAN file access.                                                                           | Moved out of OSS | No active auth-copy cleanup remains; keep local-file-access wording and let boundary scanners catch regressions. |
| Unused auth copy        | Desktop renderer locale `authPage` blocks were removed after confirming no non-locale references.                                                                                      | Removed          | Keep absent; official account UI copy belongs in an overlay.                                                     |
| Support/update backend  | Desktop support/update network paths were removed; diagnostics now export a local archive only. The old unmounted support panel, reset-state IPC, and reset support copy were removed. | Removed from OSS | Keep official support upload, update-check clients, and destructive support reset entrypoints out of OSS.        |
| Local pairing/resources | Dashboard QR pairing, IPC local sidecar, received library and shared resources are local LAN features.                                                                                 | Keep baseline    | Do not remove; these are not manual mobile upload alternatives.                                                  |

| Auth state shell                   | Mobile auth store no longer exposes user/profile/subscription snapshots, token globals, or old token cleanup. It keeps only guest/dev-session route state.            | Removed from OSS      | Keep official profile bootstrap and token rotation out of OSS.                                                                          |
| Broad feature gate                 | `isFeatureAccessAllowed` was removed from `auth-store`; `SyncActivityScreen.tsx` no longer consumes auth state for local sync activity.                               | Removed from OSS      | Keep foreground LAN sync activity independent of account/subscription state.                                                            |
| API bearer auth                    | `apps/mobile/src/services/api.ts` was removed with the remaining support-upload client path.                                                                          | Removed from OSS      | Keep official account/support API callers absent from OSS.                                                                              |
| Local diagnostics export           | Mobile diagnostics now routes through `shareDiagnosticsArchive`, which asks the native engine for a local archive and opens the system share sheet.                   | Keep baseline         | Keep local export/share only; do not add official support upload APIs.                                                                  |
| Auth service bridge                | `apps/mobile/src/services/auth-service.ts` keeps only a clear callback for session-replaced API responses.                                                            | Keep baseline         | Keep as route-state cleanup only; do not add token rotation or official profile helpers.                                                |
| App config                         | `apps/mobile/src/services/app-config-service.ts` no longer calls paid native feature toggles.                                                                         | Keep fail-closed stub | Keep OSS no-op; official overlay must own positive native config.                                                                       |
| Native tunnel bridge               | `apps/mobile/src/services/SyncEngineModule.ts` no longer exports a tunnel credential bridge; native bridges were removed.                                             | Moved out of OSS      | Keep removed; official overlays must own any positive tunnel credential path.                                                           |

| Local computer naming              | `LocalComputerGlobalScreen.tsx`, `LocalComputerScreen.tsx`, and `GlobalLocalComputer*` service helpers browse the paired desktop personal directory over LAN.         | Keep baseline         | Keep LAN browsing independent of account/tunnel state; only native wire-compatibility text may mention historical remote-access errors. |
| OSS locale namespace               | Mobile OSS information copy now uses the neutral `oss` i18n namespace and `oss.json` locale files.                                                                    | Removed from OSS      | Keep paid subscription locale namespaces out of the community runtime.                                                                  |

| Service endpoints            | `packages/contracts/src/service-endpoints.ts:1` exports only the public web URL and support email. Broad API, support API, update-check, and diagnostics-upload endpoint exports were removed from contracts and release/dev profiles. | Removed from OSS | Keep official account, entitlement, auth, tunnel, support upload, and update API constants out of public OSS contracts.             |

| Personal API                 | `/personal/*` routes are local-network only and authorize with paired-device HMAC (`router.go`, `handlers_personal.go`); tests assert bearer tokens alone are rejected.                                                                | Keep baseline    | Treat as local paired-device HMAC browsing, not official account remote access.                                                     |
| Mobile resources/presence    | `router.go:144`, `router.go:163`, `handlers_resources.go:1028`, `presence.go:44`.                                                                                                                                                      | Hardened         | Public/non-LAN HTTP access is rejected; mobile resource handlers also enforce local-network source before paired `clientId` checks. |
| Store schema                 | `001_initial.sql:1`, `005_desktop_local_management.sql:25`.                                                                                                                                                                            | Keep baseline    | No account/tunnel/entitlement persistence exists in sidecar store.                                                                  |

## Documentation And QA Drift

| Area                    | Evidence                                                                                                                                                                 | Classification | Next action                                                                                                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Community build docs    | `docs/open-source/community-build.md:23` states commercial remote/tunnel/background native runtime is absent from community builds.                                      | Keep baseline  | Keep aligned with release and QA gates.                                                                    |
| Beta matrix background  | `docs/testing/beta-test-matrix.md` now treats OSS background as fail-closed and validates foreground pending-queue recovery instead of paid background continuation.     | Keep baseline  | Keep aligned with foreground recovery smoke evidence.                                                      |
| Feature boundary        | `docs/commercial/feature-boundary.md:25` requires official capability and entitlement for paid features.                                                                 | Keep baseline  | Use as the migration rule for follow-up tasks.                                                             |
| Release boundary checks | `scripts/release/release-profiles.mjs` only defines `review` and `prod`; release tests guard against market, support, update, diagnostics, and legacy API env injection. | Hardened       | Keep `verify:oss-boundary`, `verify:legacy-names:strict`, and source-package auditing in the release gate. |
| Beta tag doc drift      | `AGENTS.md`, `docs/release/market-release-flow.md`, and `docs/release/release-playbook.md` must stay aligned on the current cross-repo beta tag paths.                   | Harden         | Reconcile before the next TestFlight/tag run.                                                              |

## Recommended Follow-up Order

1. Reconcile release documentation drift before the next TestFlight/tag run:
   align `docs/release/release-playbook.md`,
   `docs/release/market-release-flow.md`, and `AGENTS.md` on the current
   `review` / `prod` release profiles and the correct cross-repo beta tag
   paths.
2. Make current boundary verification explicit in the release/QA gate: run or
   wire `pnpm verify:oss-source-package`, `pnpm verify:oss-boundary`,
   `pnpm verify:legacy-names:strict`, and
   `pnpm release --profile <review|prod> --targets ios,android,mac,win,linux --dry-run`.
   Allowed legacy/commercial hits should stay limited to negative fixtures,
   scanner definitions, compatibility migrations, and historical docs.
3. Use the captured OSS beta smoke evidence in
   `docs/testing/global-only-qa.md#2026-07-02-oss-beta-smoke-evidence` as the
   current automated baseline for guest LAN route behavior, pending-queue
   recovery, `/personal/*` paired-device HMAC access, local diagnostics export,
   and removed support upload/update/reset-state runtime entrypoints. Complete
   the remaining true-device LAN, media permission, interruption/resume and
   share-sheet checks before beta sign-off.
4. Keep deferred migrations separate from this commercial cleanup inventory:
   package scope, mDNS service, old data-dir/keychain/shared-preference,
   native package/bundle IDs, and store-listing continuity need dedicated
   migration plans.
