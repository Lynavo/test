**Date**: 2026-07-13  
**Status**: Proposed (Pending User Review)

## 1. Project Context & Objectives

To optimize the reader journey and establish clear project boundaries for the open-source community, we will adjust the section order of `README.md`.

Our objectives are:
- Prioritize high-level project specs: Bring **OSS Boundaries**, **Tech Stack**, and **Architecture Overview** closer to the top.
- Postpone configuration details: Move **Prerequisites**, **Common Commands**, **Build & Package Verification**, and **Project Structure** lower down, keeping developer-heavy parts folded.
- Keep onboarding smooth: Keep **Quick Start** and **FAQs & Troubleshooting** closely connected in the middle.

5. **🚀 Quick Start**
6. **❓ FAQs & Troubleshooting**

## 3. Implementation Details

We will rearrange the Markdown sections within `/Volumes/T7/Dev/Web/vividrop-client/README.md` strictly keeping all section titles, code blocks, lists, details components, and text intact.
Prettier format checking (`pnpm format:check`) and TypeScript verification (`pnpm typecheck`) will be performed afterward to ensure no syntax issues occur.
