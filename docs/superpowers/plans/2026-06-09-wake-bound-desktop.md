# Wake Bound Desktop From Shared Files Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Allow mobile to attempt same-LAN Wake-on-LAN when the user opens the bound desktop's "My Computer" shared files directory or manually taps "Sync Status" -> "Reconnect" as a LAN retry while the desktop LAN sidecar is unreachable after sleep.

**Architecture:** The desktop sidecar publishes wake metadata only while it is awake. Mobile persists that metadata with the bound desktop record, then sends Wake-on-LAN magic packets from iOS/Android before falling back to the current P2P/direct-route behavior. Public wake is ordered by explicit network capability: router Wake-on-WAN or router helper first, same-LAN WoL when the phone is in the LAN, configured public wake target when the router forwards UDP, peer proxy only when another authenticated Vivi Drop desktop is already awake on the LAN/VPN, and VPN only as fallback guidance. Wake attempts are scoped to explicit user actions: shared-files browsing may later use router-first public wake, while manual reconnect remains a LAN/VPN-LAN retry only. Upload queue semantics, passive presence recovery, sync state machine, and pairing identity remain unchanged.

**Tech Stack:** Go sidecar HTTP/TCP protocol, TypeScript contracts, React Native renderer, iOS Swift native SyncEngine, Android Kotlin native SyncEngine, Vitest, Go test, Android unit tests, standalone Swift policy tests.

## Phase Boundary

This plan implements Phase 1 from `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-09-public-wake-design.md`: same-LAN wake for explicit user actions. It must not be described as guaranteed public-internet wake, and the Sync Status reconnect button must not be described as an external-network wake control.

Public wake from outside the LAN is possible only when the user has a network path that can deliver a magic packet into the desktop LAN. The preferred public path is router Wake-on-WAN, router directed broadcast forwarding, or a router-provided wake helper. A configured public wake target is the direct UDP form of the router Wake-on-WAN path. Peer Proxy / WOL Relay is lower priority and works only when another authenticated Vivi Drop desktop is already awake on the same LAN/VPN and can send the packet locally. A router-connected device that does not run Vivi Drop Desktop is not a peer proxy; it can participate only through an explicitly configured third-party helper/webhook/router API integration. VPN is fallback only when router wake cannot be configured; it must not become the primary public wake solution or default setup path. If the user has only one sleeping computer and no router wake/helper, configured public wake target, authenticated awake peer, explicitly configured third-party helper, or VPN fallback, there is no reliable way for SyncFlow or a cloud service to wake that computer from the public internet.

Follow-up implementation should add explicit `wake_setup_required` and `wake_unavailable` states before adding any public wake settings. Public wake settings should prioritize router host/port or router helper configuration, with VPN presented only as fallback guidance. Product copy, onboarding, and diagnostics must not make VPN look like the main public wake setup. This avoids showing an endless `waking` state when the phone is outside the LAN and no wake path exists.

The product must also add platform-specific Wake-on-LAN setup guidance for macOS and Windows. The app can guide, detect some local signals, and explain failure causes, but it must not claim that Vivi Drop can automatically enable BIOS/UEFI, NIC power-management, router, or OS sleep settings for the user.

Opening the mobile app, returning to foreground, or rendering an offline state is not a wake trigger. Opening `我的電腦` can start the shared-files wake sequence. Manually tapping `同步狀態` -> `重新連接` can start only a LAN/VPN-LAN retry sequence.

## Capability Model

The product behavior should be evaluated using this matrix:

## Wake Path Priority

Use this priority whenever public or assisted wake behavior is added. It is product policy, not just an implementation detail:

1. **Router Wake-on-WAN / router helper**: preferred public wake path. This includes router-provided WoL APIs, router management helpers, or directed broadcast forwarding configured by the user.
2. **Direct same-LAN Wake-on-LAN**: used when mobile is on the same LAN as the bound desktop, or on a VPN path that truly behaves like that LAN.
3. **Configured public wake target**: direct UDP packet to a user-configured public host/port, normally backed by router port forwarding or directed broadcast. This is a router Wake-on-WAN transport, not a cloud wake feature.
4. **Peer Proxy / WOL Relay**: optional assisted wake only when another authenticated Vivi Drop desktop is already awake and reachable on the same LAN/VPN. It must never be presented as a solution for the single-computer case.
5. **VPN fallback**: guidance only. Installing Vivi Drop must not require installing VPN software, and VPN must not be the default public wake setup.
6. **Third-party webhook / router API extensions**: future advanced integrations for NAS, OpenWrt, Home Assistant, router-specific APIs, or other always-on LAN devices that do not run Vivi Drop Desktop. These devices must be explicitly configured and authenticated; do not auto-discover arbitrary LAN devices as wake relays, and do not block the core Wake-on-WAN plan on these integrations.

## Product And Platform Constraints

- Wake-on-LAN is a best-effort LAN feature. It cannot guarantee wake on every Mac, Windows PC, network adapter, router, sleep mode, hibernate mode, or Wi-Fi power mode.
- macOS users may need System Settings -> Battery or Energy Saver -> "Wake for network access". Ethernet is more reliable than sleeping Wi-Fi.
- Windows users may need BIOS/UEFI Wake-on-LAN enabled and NIC settings such as "Allow this device to wake the computer" and "Only allow a magic packet to wake the computer". Modern Standby, hibernate, and shutdown behavior varies by device.
- Cross-subnet wake is not reliable unless the router forwards directed broadcast, provides a Wake-on-LAN helper, or the phone is connected through VPN. Router Wake-on-WAN/helper is the preferred public path; VPN is fallback. This implementation only targets same-LAN behavior.
- Public-internet wake is setup-gated and must not be promised by default. A cloud relay alone cannot wake a deeply sleeping computer behind NAT without an always-online LAN participant or router support.
- The mobile app must never depend on sidecar or mDNS responses after the desktop is asleep. It must cache wake metadata before the desktop sleeps.
- Do not publish MAC addresses in mDNS TXT records. Publish wake targets only through protocol and paired/presence responses.
- Setup guidance must separate prevention from wake: `同步時防止電腦睡眠` reduces interruptions while transfer is active, but it is not Wake-on-LAN setup and must not be presented as equivalent.

## Platform Setup Guidance Requirements

Wake setup must be visible before users rely on the feature and again when wake attempts fail.

Desktop guidance should be added to the existing help/settings surfaces:

- Add a "Remote Wake / Wake-on-LAN" section near system permissions or power settings.
- Explain that Vivi Drop can send wake packets only when the computer, network adapter, router, and sleep mode allow it.
- Make the guidance platform-specific instead of using a single generic checklist.
- Avoid requiring VPN as the main setup path. VPN can be mentioned only as fallback when it makes the phone behave as if it is on the LAN and wake packets can pass.

macOS guidance must include:

- Open System Settings -> Battery or Energy Saver.
- Enable `Wake for network access` when available.
- Prefer Ethernet for reliable sleep wake. Wi-Fi wake varies by Mac model, power state, and router.
- Keep Vivi Drop allowed through firewall and Local Network permissions, because wake recovery still needs `/health` and LAN reconnect after the machine wakes.
- Clarify that the app cannot force-enable this system setting from the renderer or mobile app.

Windows guidance must include:

- Enable Wake-on-LAN in BIOS/UEFI if the machine exposes it.
- Device Manager -> Network adapters -> selected adapter -> Power Management: enable `Allow this device to wake the computer` and usually `Only allow a magic packet to wake the computer`.
- Adapter Advanced tab: enable options such as `Wake on Magic Packet`, `Wake on pattern match`, or vendor-equivalent names when present.
- Prefer Ethernet. Wi-Fi WoL, Modern Standby, hibernate, fast startup, and shutdown behavior vary heavily by device and driver.
- Clarify that Vivi Drop cannot modify BIOS/UEFI or all NIC driver settings automatically.

Mobile failure guidance should be contextual:

- If wake metadata is missing, tell the user to open Vivi Drop on the desktop while it is awake, reconnect once, then try again.
- If wake polling times out, show platform setup guidance and keep existing P2P/direct fallback behavior.
- If the phone is outside the LAN and no router wake/helper or VPN-LAN path is configured, say that `重新連接` is LAN retry only and cannot wake a NAT-hidden sleeping desktop from the public internet.

## Route Behavior

Opening "My Computer" means `browseSharedFiles(scope: "personal", path: "", accessToken)` from `apps/mobile/src/services/SyncEngineModule.ts`, which reaches iOS `SyncEngineManager.browseSharedFiles` and Android `NativeSyncEngineModule.browseSharedFiles`.

The native route resolver should follow this order:

1. Probe the current fresh LAN host quickly with `/health`.
2. If reachable, use the existing LAN route.
3. If unreachable and the request is `scope == "personal"` with `kind == "list"`, emit reachability `waking`, send Wake-on-LAN packets from persisted wake metadata, then poll `/health` for up to 25 seconds.
4. If the desktop wakes, use the existing LAN route and mark shared files `available/lan`.
5. If it does not wake, continue the existing P2P tunnel wait and cached-direct fallback behavior.
6. If all routes fail, keep current unavailable/network-error behavior.

This route behavior assumes the phone is on the same LAN. VPN may make the phone logically same-LAN, but that is a fallback path and still depends on whether the VPN/router path carries wake traffic. If mobile is on an unrelated public network, the same-LAN wake packet may never reach the desktop. A follow-up phase should first try router Wake-on-WAN/router helper targets, then configured public wake targets, then authenticated Vivi Drop Desktop peer proxy if an awake peer exists, then explicitly configured third-party helper integrations, then VPN guidance. It should surface `wake_setup_required` instead of showing `waking` for the full timeout when none of those paths exists.

## Manual Reconnect LAN Retry Behavior

The manual reconnect button in `apps/mobile/src/screens/SyncActivityScreen.tsx` should be a LAN retry, not a public wake button. The intended order is:

1. User sees the bound desktop as offline in the sync status/activity surface.
2. User taps `重新連接`.
3. JS calls a native method such as `NativeSyncEngine.retryLanReconnect({ allowWake: true })`.
4. Native code first performs the existing reconnect path: start discovery, probe the latest LAN host, and let normal trigger-sync recovery run if the desktop is already reachable.
5. If the latest LAN host is unreachable and the phone is on the same LAN, or on a VPN path that behaves like the LAN, native code enters the bounded same-LAN wake orchestration.
6. If `/health` recovers during polling, native code marks the desktop reachable and resumes the existing sync trigger path.
7. If the phone is outside the LAN with no VPN LAN path, the button does not attempt router Wake-on-WAN. Native code returns to existing offline/backoff behavior and JS keeps the current reconnect failure UI.
8. If LAN wake fails, native code returns to existing offline/backoff behavior and JS keeps the current reconnect failure UI.

`SyncStatusScreen.tsx` must not call the wake method from render, focus effects, foreground listeners, or passive offline banners. Passive offline UI may say the user can tap reconnect, but the wake packet is sent only after the tap.

## Task 1: Contracts Wake DTOs

**Files:**

- Modify: `packages/contracts/src/enums.ts`
- Modify: `packages/contracts/src/types.ts`
- Test: `packages/contracts/src/__tests__/exports.test.ts`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing contracts test**

Add this compile-time assertion block to `packages/contracts/src/__tests__/exports.test.ts` near existing DTO export checks:

```ts
import type {
  BindingStateDTO,
  SharedFilesReachabilityDTO,
  WakeCapabilityDTO,
  WakeTargetDTO,
} from '../types';

function expectWakeTypes(
  target: WakeTargetDTO,
  wake: WakeCapabilityDTO,
  binding: BindingStateDTO,
  reachability: SharedFilesReachabilityDTO,
): void {
  expect(target.macAddress).toBe('aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff');
  expect(wake.targets[0]?.broadcastAddress).toBe('192.168.1.255');
  expect(binding.wake?.supported).toBe(true);
  expect(reachability.state).toBe('waking');
}

it('exports wake metadata DTOs for bound desktop wake attempts', () => {
  const target: WakeTargetDTO = {
    interfaceName: 'en0',
    macAddress: 'aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff',
    ipv4Address: '192.168.1.20',
    broadcastAddress: '192.168.1.255',
    ports: [9, 7],
  };
  const wake: WakeCapabilityDTO = {
    supported: true,
    targets: [target],
    updatedAt: '2026-06-09T03:00:00.000Z',
  };
  const binding: BindingStateDTO = {
    deviceId: 'desktop-1',
    deviceName: 'Studio Mac',
    deviceAlias: 'Studio Mac',
    host: '192.168.1.20',
    port: 39393,
    connectionState: 'offline',
    pairingId: 'pair-1',
    shareEnabled: true,
    shareName: 'My Computer',
    lastBoundAt: '2026-06-09T03:00:00.000Z',
    wake,
  };
  const reachability: SharedFilesReachabilityDTO = {
    deviceId: 'desktop-1',
    state: 'waking',
    route: null,
    reason: 'wake_attempt_started',
    updatedAt: '2026-06-09T03:00:01.000Z',
  };

  expectWakeTypes(target, wake, binding, reachability);
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the contracts test and verify it fails**

Run: `pnpm --filter @lynavo-drive/contracts test -- exports.test.ts`

Expected: TypeScript reports that `WakeCapabilityDTO`, `WakeTargetDTO`, `BindingStateDTO.wake`, or `SharedFilesReachabilityDTO.state = "waking"` is not defined.

- [ ] **Step 3: Add wake DTOs and the waking reachability state**

Change `packages/contracts/src/enums.ts`:

```ts
export type SharedFilesReachabilityState = 'unknown' | 'available' | 'unavailable' | 'waking';
```

Add these interfaces before `BindingStateDTO` in `packages/contracts/src/types.ts`:

```ts
export interface WakeTargetDTO {
  interfaceName: string;
  macAddress: string;
  ipv4Address: string;
  broadcastAddress: string;
  ports: number[];
}

export interface WakeCapabilityDTO {
  supported: boolean;
  targets: WakeTargetDTO[];
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

Extend `BindingStateDTO`:

```ts
export interface BindingStateDTO {
  deviceId: string;
  deviceName: string;
  /** User-defined alias, defaults to deviceName */
  deviceAlias: string;
  host: string;
  port: number;
  connectionState: ConnectionState;
  pairingId: string;
  shareEnabled: boolean;
  shareName?: string;
  lastBoundAt: string;
  sharedFilesReachability?: SharedFilesReachabilityDTO | null;
  wake?: WakeCapabilityDTO | null;
}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run contracts tests**

Run: `pnpm --filter @lynavo-drive/contracts test -- exports.test.ts`

Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 5: Build contracts**

Run: `pnpm --filter @lynavo-drive/contracts build`

Expected: package builds without TypeScript errors.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add packages/contracts/src/enums.ts packages/contracts/src/types.ts packages/contracts/src/__tests__/exports.test.ts
git commit -m "feat: add wake metadata contracts"
```

## Task 2: Sidecar Wake Metadata Provider

**Files:**

- Create: `services/sidecar-go/internal/wake/metadata.go`
- Test: `services/sidecar-go/internal/wake/metadata_test.go`
- Modify: `services/sidecar-go/internal/protocol/messages.go`

- [ ] **Step 1: Add protocol wake structs**

Add these types to `services/sidecar-go/internal/protocol/messages.go` before `ServerCapabilities`:

```go
// WakeTarget describes one LAN interface target for Wake-on-LAN packets.
type WakeTarget struct {
	InterfaceName    string `json:"interfaceName"`
	MACAddress       string `json:"macAddress"`
	IPv4Address      string `json:"ipv4Address"`
	BroadcastAddress string `json:"broadcastAddress"`
	Ports            []int  `json:"ports"`
}

// WakeCapability is advertised while the sidecar is awake and cached by mobile.
type WakeCapability struct {
	Supported bool         `json:"supported"`
	Targets   []WakeTarget `json:"targets"`
	UpdatedAt string       `json:"updatedAt"`
}
```

Extend `ServerCapabilities`:

```go
type ServerCapabilities struct {
	ShareEnabled        bool            `json:"shareEnabled"`
	ShareName           string          `json:"shareName"`
	LowDiskPauseEnabled bool            `json:"lowDiskPauseEnabled"`
	Wake                *WakeCapability `json:"wake,omitempty"`
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Write wake metadata tests**

Create `services/sidecar-go/internal/wake/metadata_test.go`:

```go

}
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Run the wake tests and verify they fail**

Run: `cd services/sidecar-go && go test ./internal/wake`

Expected: FAIL because the package or functions do not exist.

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement metadata collection**

Create `services/sidecar-go/internal/wake/metadata.go`:

```go
package wake

import (
	"net"
	"strings"
	"time"

	"github.com/nicksyncflow/sidecar/internal/protocol"
)

type interfaceSnapshot struct {
	name         string

	if err != nil {
		return protocol.WakeCapability{
			Supported: false,
			Targets:   []protocol.WakeTarget{},
			UpdatedAt: time.Now().UTC().Format(time.RFC3339Nano),
		}
	}
	snapshots := make([]interfaceSnapshot, 0, len(interfaces))
	for _, iface := range interfaces {
		addrs, err := iface.Addrs()
		if err != nil {
			continue
		}
		snapshots = append(snapshots, interfaceSnapshot{
			name:         iface.Name,

	}
	return metadataFromInterfaceSnapshots(snapshots, time.Now().UTC())

				IPv4Address:      ipv4.String(),
				BroadcastAddress: broadcastAddress(ipv4, ipNet.Mask),
				Ports:            []int{9, 7},
			})
		}
	}
	return protocol.WakeCapability{
		Supported: len(targets) > 0,
		Targets:   targets,
		UpdatedAt: now.UTC().Format(time.RFC3339Nano),
	}
}

func isUsableInterface(snapshot interfaceSnapshot) bool {

	out := make(net.IP, net.IPv4len)
	for i := 0; i < net.IPv4len; i++ {
		out[i] = ipv4[i] | ^mask[i]
	}
	return out.String()
}
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Run wake tests**

Run: `cd services/sidecar-go && go test ./internal/wake`

Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add services/sidecar-go/internal/protocol/messages.go services/sidecar-go/internal/wake/metadata.go services/sidecar-go/internal/wake/metadata_test.go
git commit -m "feat: collect sidecar wake metadata"
```

## Task 3: Publish Wake Metadata From Sidecar

**Files:**

- Modify: `services/sidecar-go/internal/server/handler_hello.go`
- Modify: `services/sidecar-go/internal/api/handlers_health.go`
- Modify: `services/sidecar-go/internal/api/presence.go`
- Test: `services/sidecar-go/internal/server/connection_test.go`
- Test: `services/sidecar-go/internal/api/router_test.go`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write API response tests**

In `services/sidecar-go/internal/api/router_test.go`, add assertions to the existing health test or create this test using the existing router test helpers:

```go
func TestHealthAdvertisesWakeSupportWithoutTargets(t *testing.T) {
	_, handler := newTestServer(t)
	req := httptest.NewRequest(http.MethodGet, "/health", nil)
	rec := httptest.NewRecorder()

	handler.ServeHTTP(rec, req)

	if rec.Code != http.StatusOK {
		t.Fatalf("status = %d, want 200", rec.Code)
	}
	var body map[string]any
	if err := json.Unmarshal(rec.Body.Bytes(), &body); err != nil {
		t.Fatalf("decode health: %v", err)
	}
	capabilities := body["capabilities"].(map[string]any)
	if _, ok := capabilities["wakeOnLanSupported"]; !ok {
		t.Fatalf("health capabilities missing wakeOnLanSupported: %#v", capabilities)
	}
	if _, leaked := capabilities["wake"]; leaked {
		t.Fatalf("health must not expose MAC wake targets")
	}
}
```

In the presence test that creates a paired device, assert:

```go
	if _, ok := body["wake"].(map[string]any); !ok {
		t.Fatalf("paired presence response missing wake metadata: %#v", body)
	}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run sidecar API tests and verify they fail**

Run: `cd services/sidecar-go && go test ./internal/api`

Expected: FAIL because wake fields are not present.

- [ ] **Step 3: Publish wake support in health without MAC targets**

Modify `services/sidecar-go/internal/api/handlers_health.go`:

```go
import (
	"net/http"

	"github.com/nicksyncflow/sidecar/internal/protocol"
	"github.com/nicksyncflow/sidecar/internal/wake"
)

func (s *Server) handleHealth(w http.ResponseWriter, _ *http.Request) {
	wakeCapability := wake.Metadata()
	writeJSON(w, http.StatusOK, map[string]any{
		"ok":                      true,
		"service":                 "syncflow-sidecar",
		"version":                 "0.1.0",
		"appCompatibilityVersion": protocol.AppCompatibilityVersion,
		"capabilities": map[string]any{
			"revokesPairingsOnCodeRotation": true,
			"wakeOnLanSupported":            wakeCapability.Supported,
		},
	})
}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Include full wake metadata in paired presence**

Modify `services/sidecar-go/internal/api/presence.go` after server identity lookup:

```go
	includeWake := false
	device, deviceErr := s.store.GetPairedDevice(clientID)
	if deviceErr == nil && device != nil && device.RevokedAt == nil {
		includeWake = true
	}

	response := map[string]any{
		"ok":         true,
		"serverId":   serverID,
		"serverName": serverName,
		"shareName":  shareName,
	}
	if includeWake {
		response["wake"] = wake.Metadata()
	}
	writeJSON(w, http.StatusOK, response)
```

Add the import:

```go
	"github.com/nicksyncflow/sidecar/internal/wake"
```

Replace the existing final `writeJSON` call with the `response` map above.

- [ ] **Step 5: Include wake metadata in HELLO response**

Modify `services/sidecar-go/internal/server/handler_hello.go` imports:

```go
	"github.com/nicksyncflow/sidecar/internal/wake"
```

After `caps := protocol.ServerCapabilities{ LowDiskPauseEnabled: true }`, set:

```go
	wakeCapability := wake.Metadata()
	caps.Wake = &wakeCapability
```

This exposes targets through the TCP protocol response used by paired and newly pairing mobile clients.

- [ ] **Step 6: Run sidecar tests**

Run: `cd services/sidecar-go && go test ./internal/api ./internal/server ./internal/protocol ./internal/wake`

Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash
git add services/sidecar-go/internal/api/handlers_health.go services/sidecar-go/internal/api/presence.go services/sidecar-go/internal/server/handler_hello.go services/sidecar-go/internal/api/router_test.go services/sidecar-go/internal/server/connection_test.go
git commit -m "feat: publish wake metadata to paired mobile clients"
```

## Task 4: Persist Wake Metadata On iOS

**Files:**

- Create: `apps/mobile/ios/SyncEngine/WakeMetadata.swift`
- Modify: `apps/mobile/ios/SyncEngine/UploadStore.swift`
- Modify: `apps/mobile/ios/SyncEngine/SyncEngineManager.swift`

- [ ] **Step 1: Add iOS wake model structs**

Create `apps/mobile/ios/SyncEngine/WakeMetadata.swift`:

```swift
import Foundation

struct WakeTargetRecord: Codable {
    let interfaceName: String
    let macAddress: String
    let ipv4Address: String
    let broadcastAddress: String
    let ports: [Int]
}

struct WakeCapabilityRecord: Codable {
    let supported: Bool
    let targets: [WakeTargetRecord]
    let updatedAt: String
}
```

Extend `BindingRecord`:

```swift
struct BindingRecord {
    let deviceId: String
    var deviceName: String
    var deviceAlias: String?
    let deviceType: String
    var host: String
    let port: Int
    let pairingId: String
    let pairingTokenKeychainRef: String
    var shareName: String?
    let lastBoundAt: String
    var wake: WakeCapabilityRecord?
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Persist wake JSON with binding**

In the migration section that uses `addColumnIfMissing`, add:

```swift
try addColumnIfMissing(table: "binding", column: "wake_metadata_json", definition: "TEXT")
```

Update `getBinding()` SQL to select `wake_metadata_json`, decode it with:

```swift
let wake: WakeCapabilityRecord?
if let rawWake = row["wake_metadata_json"] as? String,
   let wakeData = rawWake.data(using: .utf8) {
    wake = try? JSONDecoder().decode(WakeCapabilityRecord.self, from: wakeData)
} else {
    wake = nil
}
```

Pass `wake: wake` to `BindingRecord`.

Update `saveBinding(_:)` to insert the `wake_metadata_json` column:

```swift
let wakeJSON: String?
if let wake = binding.wake,
   let data = try? JSONEncoder().encode(wake) {
    wakeJSON = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8)
} else {
    wakeJSON = nil
}
```

Use:

```swift
INSERT OR REPLACE INTO binding (id, device_id, device_name, device_alias, device_type, host, port, pairing_id, pairing_token_keychain_ref, share_name, last_bound_at, wake_metadata_json)
VALUES (1, ?1, ?2, ?3, ?4, ?5, ?6, ?7, ?8, ?9, ?10, ?11)
```

and append `.textOrNull(wakeJSON)` to the bindings array.

- [ ] **Step 3: Add parser helper in SyncEngineManager**

Add to `apps/mobile/ios/SyncEngine/SyncEngineManager.swift`:

```swift
private func wakeCapability(from value: Any?) -> WakeCapabilityRecord? {
    guard let dict = value as? [String: Any] else { return nil }
    let supported = dict["supported"] as? Bool ?? false
    let updatedAt = dict["updatedAt"] as? String ?? diagnosticsTimestamp()
    let targetsRaw = dict["targets"] as? [[String: Any]] ?? []
    let targets = targetsRaw.compactMap { raw -> WakeTargetRecord? in
        guard
            let interfaceName = raw["interfaceName"] as? String,
            let macAddress = raw["macAddress"] as? String,
            let ipv4Address = raw["ipv4Address"] as? String,
            let broadcastAddress = raw["broadcastAddress"] as? String
        else {
            return nil
        }
        return WakeTargetRecord(
            interfaceName: interfaceName,
            macAddress: macAddress,
            ipv4Address: ipv4Address,
            broadcastAddress: broadcastAddress,
            ports: raw["ports"] as? [Int] ?? [9, 7]
        )
    }
    return WakeCapabilityRecord(supported: supported && !targets.isEmpty, targets: targets, updatedAt: updatedAt)
}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Attach wake to binding state payload**

In `bindingStatePayload`, add:

```swift
if let wake = binding.wake,
   let data = try? JSONEncoder().encode(wake),
   let object = try? JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: data) {
    payload["wake"] = object
} else {
    payload["wake"] = NSNull()
}
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Save wake from HELLO and presence**

Where `BindingRecord` is constructed from HELLO and pair responses, pass:

```swift
wake: wakeCapability(from: helloResponse["serverCapabilities"].flatMap { ($0 as? [String: Any])?["wake"] })
```

Where presence heartbeat decodes a successful response, persist any new metadata:

```swift
if let wake = wakeCapability(from: response["wake"]),
   var current = uploadStore?.getBinding(),
   current.deviceId == binding.deviceId {
    current.wake = wake
    try? uploadStore?.saveBinding(current)
    syncDiagnosticsLog("Wake", "updated wake metadata targets=\(wake.targets.count) updatedAt=\(wake.updatedAt)")
}
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Compile iOS native code**

Run: `pnpm --filter @lynavo-drive/mobile exec tsc --noEmit`

Expected: PASS for JS/TS bridge types. Then run the existing iOS build command used in this repo, such as `pnpm release --profile cn-review --targets ios --dry-run` for command validation or the local Xcode simulator build when available.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash
git add apps/mobile/ios/SyncEngine/WakeMetadata.swift apps/mobile/ios/SyncEngine/UploadStore.swift apps/mobile/ios/SyncEngine/SyncEngineManager.swift
git commit -m "feat: persist iOS wake metadata"
```

## Task 5: Implement iOS Wake-on-LAN Sender

**Files:**

- Create: `apps/mobile/ios/SyncEngine/WakeOnLanService.swift`
- Test: `apps/mobile/ios/SyncEngine/WakeOnLanServiceTests/main.swift`
- Modify: iOS project file if needed so `WakeMetadata.swift` and `WakeOnLanService.swift` are included in the app target.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write packet tests**

Create `apps/mobile/ios/SyncEngine/WakeOnLanServiceTests/main.swift`:

```swift
import Foundation

func assert(_ condition: @autoclosure () -> Bool, _ message: String) {
    if !condition() {
        fatalError(message)
    }
}

let packet = try WakeOnLanService.magicPacket(macAddress: "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff")
assert(packet.count == 102, "magic packet must be 102 bytes")
assert(Array(packet.prefix(6)) == Array(repeating: 0xff, count: 6), "magic packet prefix must be ff x 6")
let mac = [0xaa, 0xbb, 0xcc, 0xdd, 0xee, 0xff].map(UInt8.init)
for index in 0..<16 {
    let start = 6 + index * 6
    assert(Array(packet[start..<(start + 6)]) == mac, "magic packet repeat \(index) mismatch")
}

let sender = CapturingWakePacketSender()
let service = WakeOnLanService(sender: sender)
let wake = WakeCapabilityRecord(
    supported: true,
    targets: [
        WakeTargetRecord(
            interfaceName: "en0",
            macAddress: "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff",
            ipv4Address: "192.168.1.20",
            broadcastAddress: "192.168.1.255",
            ports: [9, 7]
        )
    ],
    updatedAt: "2026-06-09T03:00:00.000Z"
)
let result = try service.send(wake: wake)
assert(result.sentPackets == 4, "send should target directed and limited broadcast for ports 9 and 7")
assert(sender.destinations.contains("192.168.1.255:9"), "missing directed broadcast port 9")
assert(sender.destinations.contains("255.255.255.255:7"), "missing limited broadcast port 7")

print("WakeOnLanServiceTests passed")
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the standalone test and verify it fails**

Run from `apps/mobile/ios/SyncEngine` with the same pattern used by existing standalone Swift tests:

```bash
swiftc WakeMetadata.swift SyncEngineError.swift WakeOnLanService.swift WakeOnLanServiceTests/main.swift -o /tmp/WakeOnLanServiceTests && /tmp/WakeOnLanServiceTests
```

Expected: FAIL because `WakeOnLanService.swift` does not exist.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement WakeOnLanService**

Create `apps/mobile/ios/SyncEngine/WakeOnLanService.swift`:

```swift

## Task 6: Integrate Wake Attempts Into iOS Shared Files Route

**Files:**

- Modify: `apps/mobile/ios/SyncEngine/SyncEngineManager.swift`

    updateSharedFilesReachability(.waking, route: nil, reason: reason)
}

private func attemptWakeForSharedFilesIfNeeded(
    binding: BindingRecord,
    requestedScope: SharedDirectoryScope,
    requestedPath: String,
    reason: String
) async -> Bool {
    guard requestedScope == .personal, requestedPath.trimmingCharacters(in: CharacterSet(charactersIn: "/")).isEmpty else {
        return false
    }
    guard let wake = binding.wake, wake.supported, !wake.targets.isEmpty else {
        syncDiagnosticsLog("Wake", "wake skipped reason=\(reason) metadata_missing_or_unusable")
        return false
    }

    emitSharedFilesWaking(reason: "wake_attempt_started")
    do {
        let result = try WakeOnLanService().send(wake: wake)
        syncDiagnosticsLog("Wake", "wake packets sent packets=\(result.sentPackets) targets=\(result.targetCount)")
    } catch {
        syncDiagnosticsLog("Wake", "wake packet send failed error=\(error)")
        return false
    }

    let deadline = Date().addingTimeInterval(25)
    while Date() < deadline {
        if let host = freshSharedFilesLANHost(for: binding),
           await canReachSharedFilesLANHost(host, timeout: 1.2) {
            syncDiagnosticsLog("Wake", "desktop woke via fresh LAN host=\(host)")
            return true
        }
        let fallbackHost = fallbackDirectSharedFilesHost(for: binding, excluding: nil)
        if let host = fallbackHost,
           SharedFilesRoutePolicy.isPrivateLANIPv4(host),
           await canReachSharedFilesLANHost(host, timeout: 1.2) {
            syncDiagnosticsLog("Wake", "desktop woke via cached LAN host=\(host)")
            return true
        }
        try? await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 1_000_000_000)
    }
    syncDiagnosticsLog("Wake", "wake probe timed out reason=\(reason)")
    return false
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Pass scope and path into route preparation**

Change the signature:

```swift
private func prepareSharedFilesRoute(
    reason: String,
    requestedScope: SharedDirectoryScope? = nil,
    requestedPath: String = ""
) async -> (host: String, isTunnel: Bool)
```

In `browseSharedFiles`, call:

```swift
var route = await prepareSharedFilesRoute(
    reason: "browse_shared_files",
    requestedScope: scope,
    requestedPath: path
)
```

Leave download and preview calls on the default arguments so wake is triggered by browsing the "My Computer" entry, not background preview/download retries.

- [ ] **Step 3: Invoke wake after direct LAN probes fail and before P2P wait**

Inside `prepareSharedFilesRoute`, after the cached direct LAN probe block and before `waitForP2PTunnelActive`, add:

```swift
if let requestedScope,
   await attemptWakeForSharedFilesIfNeeded(
       binding: binding,
       requestedScope: requestedScope,
       requestedPath: requestedPath,
       reason: reason
   ),
   let lanHost = await reachableSharedFilesLANHost(for: binding) {
    sharedFilesService.sidecarHost = lanHost
    sharedFilesService.useTunnelRoute = false
    applySharedFilesLANRoute(host: lanHost, reason: "wake_attempt_succeeded")
    return (lanHost, false)
}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Compile and run focused iOS route tests**

Run:

```bash
cd apps/mobile/ios/SyncEngine
swiftc SharedFilesRoutePolicy.swift SharedFilesRoutePolicyTests/main.swift -o /tmp/SharedFilesRoutePolicyTests && /tmp/SharedFilesRoutePolicyTests
```

Expected: PASS. Then run the local iOS simulator build if Xcode is available.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add apps/mobile/ios/SyncEngine/SyncEngineManager.swift
git commit -m "feat: wake desktop before iOS shared files fallback"
```

## Task 7: Persist And Send Wake On Android

**Files:**

- Modify: `apps/mobile/android/app/src/main/java/com/vividrop/mobile/china/sync/AndroidSyncPrimitives.kt`
- Modify: `apps/mobile/android/app/src/test/java/com/vividrop/mobile/china/sync/AndroidSyncPrimitivesTest.kt`
- Modify: `apps/mobile/android/app/src/main/java/com/vividrop/mobile/china/sync/NativeSyncEngineModule.kt`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write Android primitive tests**

Add to `AndroidSyncPrimitivesTest.kt`:

```kotlin
@Test
fun wakeMagicPacketRepeatsMacSixteenTimes() {
  val packet = AndroidSyncPrimitives.wakeMagicPacket("aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff")
  assertEquals(102, packet.size)
  assertEquals(List(6) { 0xff.toByte() }, packet.take(6))
  val mac = listOf(0xaa, 0xbb, 0xcc, 0xdd, 0xee, 0xff).map { it.toByte() }
  repeat(16) { index ->
    assertEquals(mac, packet.slice((6 + index * 6) until (12 + index * 6)))
  }
}

@Test
fun wakeMetadataRejectsEmptyTargets() {
  val json = JSONObject("""{"supported":true,"targets":[],"updatedAt":"2026-06-09T03:00:00.000Z"}""")
  assertFalse(AndroidSyncPrimitives.hasUsableWakeMetadata(json))
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run Android unit tests and verify they fail**

Run:

```bash
cd apps/mobile/android
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest --tests com.vividrop.mobile.china.sync.AndroidSyncPrimitivesTest
```

Expected: FAIL because the helper functions do not exist.

- [ ] **Step 3: Add Android wake helpers**

Add to `AndroidSyncPrimitives.kt`:

```kotlin
fun wakeMagicPacket(macAddress: String): ByteArray {
  val macBytes = macAddress
    .split(":")
    .map { it.toInt(16).toByte() }
  require(macBytes.size == 6) { "Invalid wake MAC address" }
  return ByteArray(6 + 16 * 6) { index ->
    if (index < 6) 0xff.toByte() else macBytes[(index - 6) % 6]
  }
}

fun hasUsableWakeMetadata(json: JSONObject?): Boolean {
  if (json == null || !json.optBoolean("supported", false)) return false
  return json.optJSONArray("targets")?.length() ?: 0 > 0
}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Extend StoredBinding**

In `NativeSyncEngineModule.kt`, add `wake: JSONObject?` to `StoredBinding`:

```kotlin
val wake: JSONObject?,
```

In `toWritableMap()`:

```kotlin
if (wake == null) {
  putNull("wake")
} else {
  putMap("wake", wake.toWritableMap())
}
```

In `toJson()` and `toDiagnosticsJson()`:

```kotlin
put("wake", wake ?: JSONObject.NULL)
```

In `fromJson()`:

```kotlin
wake = json.optJSONObject("wake"),
```

When constructing `StoredBinding` from HELLO responses, use:

```kotlin
wake = helloResponse.optJSONObject("serverCapabilities")?.optJSONObject("wake"),
```

When presence succeeds and the response includes `wake`, save a copy:

```kotlin
response.optJSONObject("wake")?.let { wake ->
  val current = loadBinding()
  if (current != null && current.deviceId == binding.deviceId) {
    saveBinding(current.copy(wake = wake))
    recordDiagnosticsLog("Wake", "updated wake metadata targets=${wake.optJSONArray("targets")?.length() ?: 0}")
  }
}
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Add Android packet sender**

Add to `NativeSyncEngineModule.kt`:

```kotlin
private fun sendWakePackets(wake: JSONObject): Int {
  val targets = wake.optJSONArray("targets") ?: return 0
  var sent = 0
  val destinations = mutableSetOf<String>()
  DatagramSocket().use { socket ->
    socket.broadcast = true
    for (targetIndex in 0 until targets.length()) {
      val target = targets.optJSONObject(targetIndex) ?: continue
      val mac = target.optString("macAddress")
      val packet = AndroidSyncPrimitives.wakeMagicPacket(mac)
      val ports = target.optJSONArray("ports") ?: JSONArray().put(9).put(7)
      val hosts = listOf(target.optString("broadcastAddress"), "255.255.255.255").filter { it.isNotBlank() }
      for (host in hosts) {
        for (portIndex in 0 until ports.length()) {
          val port = ports.optInt(portIndex)
          if (port <= 0 || port > 65535) continue
          val key = "$host:$port:$mac"
          if (!destinations.add(key)) continue
          val datagram = DatagramPacket(packet, packet.size, InetAddress.getByName(host), port)
          socket.send(datagram)
          sent += 1
        }
      }
    }
  }
  return sent
}
```

Add imports:

```kotlin
import java.net.DatagramPacket
import java.net.DatagramSocket
import java.net.InetAddress
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Route wake attempts before Android shared-files fallback**

Add:

```kotlin
private fun shouldWakeForSharedFiles(scope: String, kind: String, path: String): Boolean =
  scope.trim().equals("personal", ignoreCase = true) &&
    kind == "list" &&
    path.trim().trim('/').isBlank()

private fun attemptWakeForSharedFiles(binding: StoredBinding, reason: String): Boolean {
  val wake = binding.wake
  if (!AndroidSyncPrimitives.hasUsableWakeMetadata(wake)) {
    recordDiagnosticsLog("Wake", "wake skipped reason=$reason metadata_missing_or_unusable")
    return false
  }
  updateSharedFilesReachability(
    deviceId = binding.deviceId,
    state = "waking",
    route = null,
    reason = "wake_attempt_started",
  )
  val sent = try {
    sendWakePackets(wake!!)
  } catch (error: Throwable) {
    recordDiagnosticsLog("Wake", "wake packet send failed error=${error.message ?: error.javaClass.simpleName}")
    return false
  }
  recordDiagnosticsLog("Wake", "wake packets sent packets=$sent")
  val deadline = SystemClock.elapsedRealtime() + 25_000
  while (SystemClock.elapsedRealtime() < deadline) {
    if (probeBindingReachability(binding)) {
      recordDiagnosticsLog("Wake", "desktop woke via host=${binding.host}")
      return true
    }
    Thread.sleep(1_000)
  }
  recordDiagnosticsLog("Wake", "wake probe timed out reason=$reason")
  return false
}
```

In `resolveSharedFileRoute`, before `waitForP2PTunnelActive`, add:

```kotlin
if (shouldWakeForSharedFiles(scope, kind, path) && attemptWakeForSharedFiles(binding, reason)) {
  val directDecision = AndroidSyncPrimitives.decideSharedFilesRoute(
    isTunnelActive = false,
    tunnelPort = null,
    hasTunnelCredentials = false,
    directHost = binding.host,
    directPort = DEFAULT_SIDECAR_HTTP_PORT,
  )
  updateSharedFilesReachability(
    deviceId = binding.deviceId,
    state = "available",
    route = "lan",
    reason = "wake_attempt_succeeded",
  )
  return sharedFileRoute(scope, kind, path, requestAccessToken, directDecision, initialSnapshot)
}
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Run Android tests and build**

Run:

```bash
cd apps/mobile/android
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest --tests com.vividrop.mobile.china.sync.AndroidSyncPrimitivesTest
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Expected: both commands pass.

- [ ] **Step 8: Commit**

```bash
git add apps/mobile/android/app/src/main/java/com/vividrop/mobile/china/sync/AndroidSyncPrimitives.kt apps/mobile/android/app/src/test/java/com/vividrop/mobile/china/sync/AndroidSyncPrimitivesTest.kt apps/mobile/android/app/src/main/java/com/vividrop/mobile/china/sync/NativeSyncEngineModule.kt
git commit -m "feat: wake desktop before Android shared files fallback"
```

## Task 8: Shared Files UI Wake Status

**Files:**

- Modify: `apps/mobile/src/screens/SharedFilesScreen.tsx`
- Modify: `apps/mobile/src/i18n/locales/zh-Hant/sharedFiles.json`
- Modify: `apps/mobile/src/i18n/locales/zh-Hans/sharedFiles.json`
- Modify: `apps/mobile/src/i18n/locales/en/sharedFiles.json`
- Test: `apps/mobile/src/screens/__tests__/SharedFilesDownloadGate.test.tsx`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write UI test**

In `SharedFilesDownloadGate.test.tsx`, add a test next to existing `onSharedFilesReachabilityChanged` cases:

```tsx
it('shows waking status when native reports a wake attempt', async () => {
  const { getByText } = render(<SharedFilesScreen />);

  act(() => {
    nativeListeners.get('onSharedFilesReachabilityChanged')?.({
      deviceId: 'desktop-1',
      state: 'waking',
      route: null,
      reason: 'wake_attempt_started',
      updatedAt: '2026-06-09T03:00:00.000Z',
    });
  });

  expect(getByText('正在喚醒我的電腦')).toBeTruthy();
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the UI test and verify it fails**

Run:

```bash
pnpm --filter @lynavo-drive/mobile test -- SharedFilesDownloadGate.test.tsx
```

Expected: FAIL because `waking` is not mapped.

- [ ] **Step 3: Add waking status type and mapping**

In `SharedFilesScreen.tsx`, extend:

```ts
type SharedFilesConnectionStatus = 'lan' | 'p2p' | 'relay' | 'waking' | 'unavailable' | 'offline';
```

In the helper that maps `SharedFilesReachabilityDTO` to UI status, add:

```ts
if (state.state === 'waking') return 'waking';
```

In the connection status label lookup, use:

```ts
t(`sharedFiles.connectionStatus.${sharedFilesConnectionStatus}`);
```

so the new key is picked up with the existing status view.

- [ ] **Step 4: Add localized copy**

Update `apps/mobile/src/i18n/locales/zh-Hant/sharedFiles.json`:

```json
"connectionStatus": {
  "lan": "區域網路在線",
  "p2p": "P2P 在線",
  "relay": "中繼在線",
  "waking": "正在喚醒我的電腦",
  "unavailable": "電腦端不可達",
  "offline": "離線"
}
```

Update `zh-Hans`:

```json
"waking": "正在唤醒我的电脑"
```

Update `en`:

```json
"waking": "Waking My Computer"
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Run mobile UI tests and typecheck**

Run:

```bash
pnpm --filter @lynavo-drive/mobile test -- SharedFilesDownloadGate.test.tsx
pnpm --filter @lynavo-drive/mobile exec tsc --noEmit
```

Expected: both commands pass.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add apps/mobile/src/screens/SharedFilesScreen.tsx apps/mobile/src/screens/__tests__/SharedFilesDownloadGate.test.tsx apps/mobile/src/i18n/locales/zh-Hant/sharedFiles.json apps/mobile/src/i18n/locales/zh-Hans/sharedFiles.json apps/mobile/src/i18n/locales/en/sharedFiles.json
git commit -m "feat: show shared files wake status"
```

## Task 9: Sync Status LAN Retry Wake Trigger

**Files:**

- Modify: `apps/mobile/ios/SyncEngine/SyncEngineManager.swift`
- Modify: `apps/mobile/android/app/src/main/java/com/vividrop/mobile/china/sync/NativeSyncEngineModule.kt`
- Modify: `apps/mobile/src/screens/SyncActivityScreen.tsx`
- Modify: `apps/mobile/src/screens/SyncStatusScreen.tsx`
- Test: `apps/mobile/src/screens/__tests__/SyncActivityScreen.test.tsx`

- [ ] **Step 1: Add JS test for explicit LAN retry wake**

In `apps/mobile/src/screens/__tests__/SyncActivityScreen.test.tsx`, add a test next to the existing offline reconnect button coverage. If the file does not already mock `retryLanReconnect`, add it to the `NativeSyncEngine` mock:

```tsx
const retryLanReconnect = vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({ recovered: false });

NativeModules.NativeSyncEngine = {
  ...NativeModules.NativeSyncEngine,
  startDiscovery: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined),
  triggerSync: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined),
  retryLanReconnect,
};

it('uses the explicit LAN retry path when reconnect is tapped', async () => {
  const { getByText } = render(<SyncActivityScreen />);

  fireEvent.press(getByText('重新連接'));

  await waitFor(() => {
    expect(retryLanReconnect).toHaveBeenCalledWith({ allowWake: true });
  });
  expect(NativeModules.NativeSyncEngine.startDiscovery).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the JS test and verify it fails**

Run:

```bash
pnpm --filter @lynavo-drive/mobile test -- SyncActivityScreen.test.tsx
```

Expected: FAIL because the reconnect button still calls `startDiscovery` and `triggerSync` directly.

- [ ] **Step 3: Add iOS LAN retry native method**

In `apps/mobile/ios/SyncEngine/SyncEngineManager.swift`, add a bridge method callable as `NativeSyncEngine.retryLanReconnect({ allowWake: true })`. The method first runs the existing discovery/reconnect path; only if the LAN health probe is unreachable and `allowWake == true` does it call the same-LAN wake sender. It must not read or send configured router public wake targets.

```swift
@objc(retryLanReconnect:resolver:rejecter:)
func retryLanReconnect(
    options: NSDictionary,
    resolve: @escaping RCTPromiseResolveBlock,
    reject: @escaping RCTPromiseRejectBlock
) {
    Task {
        let allowWake = options["allowWake"] as? Bool ?? false
        do {
            startDiscovery()
            guard let binding = uploadStore?.getBinding() else {
                resolve(["recovered": false, "wakeAttempted": false])
                return
            }

            if await canReachSharedFilesLANHost(binding.host, timeout: 1.2) {
                triggerSync()
                resolve(["recovered": true, "wakeAttempted": false])
                return
            }

            var woke = false
            if allowWake {
                woke = await attemptWakeForBoundDesktop(binding: binding, reason: "lan_reconnect")
            }
            if woke {
                triggerSync()
            }
            resolve(["recovered": woke, "wakeAttempted": allowWake])
        } catch {
            reject("LAN_RETRY_FAILED", "Failed to retry LAN reconnect", error)
        }
    }
}
```

If Task 6 kept the helper named `attemptWakeForSharedFilesIfNeeded`, extract the packet send and polling body into:

```swift
private func attemptWakeForBoundDesktop(binding: BindingRecord, reason: String) async -> Bool
```

Then make `attemptWakeForSharedFilesIfNeeded(...)` call that helper after it verifies `scope == .personal` and empty path.

- [ ] **Step 4: Add Android LAN retry native method**

In `NativeSyncEngineModule.kt`, add a React method:

```kotlin
@ReactMethod
fun retryLanReconnect(options: ReadableMap, promise: Promise) {
  executor.execute {
    try {
      val allowWake = options.getBoolean("allowWake")
      startDiscoveryInternal()
      val binding = loadBinding()
      if (binding == null) {
        promise.resolve(Arguments.createMap().apply {
          putBoolean("recovered", false)
          putBoolean("wakeAttempted", false)
        })
        return@execute
      }
      if (probeBindingReachability(binding)) {
        triggerSyncInternal()
        promise.resolve(Arguments.createMap().apply {
          putBoolean("recovered", true)
          putBoolean("wakeAttempted", false)
        })
        return@execute
      }
      val woke = allowWake && attemptWakeForBoundDesktop(binding, "lan_reconnect")
      if (woke) triggerSyncInternal()
      promise.resolve(Arguments.createMap().apply {
        putBoolean("recovered", woke)
        putBoolean("wakeAttempted", allowWake)
      })
    } catch (error: Throwable) {
      promise.reject("LAN_RETRY_FAILED", "Failed to retry LAN reconnect", error)
    }
  }
}
```

This method must not load or send router public wake targets. If Task 7 kept the helper named `attemptWakeForSharedFiles`, extract the same-LAN packet send and polling body into:

```kotlin
private fun attemptWakeForBoundDesktop(binding: StoredBinding, reason: String): Boolean
```

Then make `attemptWakeForSharedFiles(binding, reason)` delegate to that helper after the shared-files route guard passes.

- [ ] **Step 5: Update the reconnect button to use the LAN retry method**

In `apps/mobile/src/screens/SyncActivityScreen.tsx`, replace the body of `handleReconnect` with:

```tsx
const handleReconnect = useCallback(async () => {
  try {
    const { NativeSyncEngine } = NativeModules;
    if (!NativeSyncEngine) return;
    if (NativeSyncEngine.retryLanReconnect) {
      await NativeSyncEngine.retryLanReconnect({ allowWake: true });
      return;
    }
    await NativeSyncEngine.startDiscovery();
    NativeSyncEngine.triggerSync?.().catch((e: Error) => {
      console.warn('[SyncActivity] triggerSync failed:', e);
    });
  } catch (e) {
    console.warn('[SyncActivity] reconnect error:', e);
    Alert.alert(
      t('syncActivity.dialogs.reconnectFailed.title'),
      t('syncActivity.dialogs.reconnectFailed.body'),
    );
  }
}, [t]);
```

The fallback keeps older native builds usable during rollout, but the primary path is the LAN retry method. This button does not invoke public Wake-on-WAN.

- [ ] **Step 6: Keep Sync Status passive**

Review `apps/mobile/src/screens/SyncStatusScreen.tsx` and confirm no render branch, focus effect, foreground listener, or reconnect banner effect calls `NativeSyncEngine.retryLanReconnect`. If a passive effect currently calls `startDiscovery` automatically on offline status, keep it as discovery-only and do not pass `allowWake: true`.

Add this comment near the offline/reconnecting banner action wiring:

```tsx
// LAN retry wake is intentionally tied to the explicit reconnect button, not passive offline rendering.
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Run mobile verification**

Run:

```bash
pnpm --filter @lynavo-drive/mobile test -- SyncActivityScreen.test.tsx
pnpm --filter @lynavo-drive/mobile exec tsc --noEmit
```

Expected: both commands pass.

- [ ] **Step 8: Commit**

```bash
git add apps/mobile/ios/SyncEngine/SyncEngineManager.swift apps/mobile/android/app/src/main/java/com/vividrop/mobile/china/sync/NativeSyncEngineModule.kt apps/mobile/src/screens/SyncActivityScreen.tsx apps/mobile/src/screens/SyncStatusScreen.tsx apps/mobile/src/screens/__tests__/SyncActivityScreen.test.tsx
git commit -m "feat: retry LAN wake from sync status reconnect"
```

- [ ] **Step 1: Add desktop macOS wake setup guidance**

Add a visible macOS section in Help or Settings. It must say:

- Enable System Settings -> Battery or Energy Saver -> `Wake for network access` when available.
- Ethernet is recommended for reliable wake. Wi-Fi wake depends on Mac model, sleep mode, power source, and router.
- Firewall and Local Network permissions still matter after wake because the phone must reconnect to desktop `/health` and sync endpoints.
- Vivi Drop sends wake packets but cannot force-enable macOS power settings for the user.

Suggested Traditional Chinese copy:

```json
{
  "title": "macOS 遠端喚醒",
  "steps": [
    "系統設定 → 電池或節能，開啟「喚醒以供網路存取」（Wake for network access）",
    "優先使用 Ethernet；Wi-Fi 睡眠喚醒會依 Mac 型號、供電狀態與路由器而不同",
    "確認防火牆允許 Vivi Drop 傳入連線，且本機網路權限已開啟",
    "Vivi Drop 可以送出喚醒封包，但不能自動替您開啟 macOS 電源設定"
  ]
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Add desktop Windows wake setup guidance**

Add a visible Windows section in Help or Settings. It must say:

- Enable Wake-on-LAN in BIOS/UEFI when the PC exposes it.
- Device Manager -> Network adapters -> adapter -> Power Management: enable `Allow this device to wake the computer`; enable `Only allow a magic packet to wake the computer` when present.
- Adapter Advanced tab: enable `Wake on Magic Packet` or the vendor-equivalent option when present.
- Ethernet is recommended. Wi-Fi WoL, Modern Standby, hibernate, fast startup, and shutdown behavior vary by device/driver.
- Vivi Drop cannot automatically modify BIOS/UEFI or every NIC driver setting.

Suggested Traditional Chinese copy:

```json
{
  "title": "Windows 遠端喚醒",
  "steps": [
    "在 BIOS/UEFI 中開啟 Wake-on-LAN（若裝置提供此選項）",

    "若有「只允許 Magic Packet 喚醒電腦」，建議一併勾選",

  ]
}
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Keep prevent-sleep copy separate from Wake-on-LAN**

Review `PowerSaveSection` and surrounding settings copy. The UI may link to or summarize remote wake setup, but it must keep this distinction:

- `同步時防止電腦睡眠`: keeps the desktop awake while an active transfer is running.
- Wake-on-LAN setup: allows a sleeping desktop to be woken later when hardware, OS, router, and network path permit it.

Do not present the prevent-sleep toggle as a replacement for platform WoL setup.

- [ ] **Step 4: Add mobile failure guidance copy**

When native wake returns metadata-missing, timeout, or unavailable reasons to JS in a follow-up state such as `wake_setup_required`, surface concise copy:

- Metadata missing: "請先在電腦端開啟 Vivi Drop 並保持清醒，讓手機更新喚醒資訊後再試。"
- Timeout: "已送出喚醒封包，但電腦沒有恢復連線。請檢查 macOS/Windows 的遠端喚醒設定。"
- External network boundary: "`重新連接` 是局域網/VPN-LAN 重試；若人在外網，需先設定路由器喚醒或可傳遞喚醒封包的 VPN。"
- Existing reconnect failure dialog may use the external-network boundary copy until native wake exposes a more precise failure reason to JS.

If the current contracts do not yet expose a detailed reason, add the copy now but wire it only after `wake_setup_required` / `wake_unavailable` states exist.

- [ ] **Step 5: Add UI tests**

Add tests that assert:

- Help page renders a macOS remote wake section with `Wake for network access`.
- Help page renders a Windows remote wake section with BIOS/UEFI and magic packet guidance.
- Settings copy, if added, does not say or imply that `同步時防止電腦睡眠` enables Wake-on-LAN.
- Mobile copy, if wired now, appears only after explicit wake failure states, not on passive offline render.

- [ ] **Step 6: Run desktop/mobile UI verification**

Run the focused tests changed by this task, then run type checks for touched packages:

```bash
pnpm --filter @lynavo-drive/desktop test -- HelpPage.test.tsx
pnpm --filter @lynavo-drive/desktop exec tsc --noEmit
pnpm --filter @lynavo-drive/mobile exec tsc --noEmit
```

## Task 11: Go Sidecar Peer Proxy Wake Endpoint

**Files:**

- Modify: `services/sidecar-go/internal/api/router.go`
- Create: `services/sidecar-go/internal/api/handlers_wake.go`
- Test: `services/sidecar-go/internal/api/router_test.go`

- [ ] **Step 1: Lock peer proxy capability boundary before coding**

Add this comment above the handler implementation in `services/sidecar-go/internal/api/handlers_wake.go` and keep the route out of any unauthenticated/public API surface:

```go
// Peer proxy wake is an optional assisted-wake path for multi-desktop setups.
// It is not a general Wake-on-WAN solution and does not help when the user has
// only one sleeping computer. The endpoint may only send Wake-on-LAN magic
// packets for authenticated, paired clients and bounded wake targets.
```

The endpoint path should follow the existing local sidecar route style:

```go
mux.HandleFunc("POST /wake/proxy", withJSON(srv.handleProxyWake))
```

Do not use `/api/v1/wake/proxy` unless the sidecar local API is intentionally migrated to a versioned prefix in a separate plan.

- [ ] **Step 2: Write proxy wake router tests**

In `services/sidecar-go/internal/api/router_test.go`, add tests that use the existing `testEnv(t)`, `api.NewServer`, and `httptest.NewServer` pattern. The tests must cover all of these cases before implementation:

```go
func TestProxyWakeRequiresAccountAuthorization(t *testing.T) {
	st, cfg, hub := testEnv(t)
	_, handler := api.NewServer(st, cfg, hub, nil)
	srv := httptest.NewServer(handler)
	defer srv.Close()

	resp, err := http.Post(srv.URL+"/wake/proxy", "application/json", strings.NewReader(`{}`))
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatalf("POST /wake/proxy: %v", err)
	}
	defer resp.Body.Close()
	if resp.StatusCode != http.StatusUnauthorized {
		t.Fatalf("status=%d, want 401", resp.StatusCode)
	}
}

func TestProxyWakeRejectsUnpairedClient(t *testing.T) {
	st, cfg, hub := testEnv(t)
	authSrv := profileAuthServer(t, "acct-1")
	defer authSrv.Close()
	apiSrv, handler := api.NewServer(st, cfg, hub, nil)
	apiSrv.SetDesktopAuthContextForTest("acct-1", authSrv.URL)
	srv := httptest.NewServer(handler)
	defer srv.Close()

	reqBody := `{"clientId":"unknown-mobile","macAddress":"aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff","broadcastAddress":"192.168.1.255","ports":[9]}`
	req, err := http.NewRequest(http.MethodPost, srv.URL+"/wake/proxy", strings.NewReader(reqBody))
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatalf("new request: %v", err)
	}
	req.Header.Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
	req.Header.Set("Authorization", "Bearer "+fakeAccountJWT(t, "acct-1"))

	resp, err := http.DefaultClient.Do(req)
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatalf("POST /wake/proxy: %v", err)
	}
	defer resp.Body.Close()
	if resp.StatusCode != http.StatusForbidden {
		t.Fatalf("status=%d, want 403", resp.StatusCode)
	}
}

func TestProxyWakeRejectsUnsafeTarget(t *testing.T) {
	st, cfg, hub := testEnv(t)
	authSrv := profileAuthServer(t, "acct-1")
	defer authSrv.Close()
	apiSrv, handler := api.NewServer(st, cfg, hub, nil)
	apiSrv.SetDesktopAuthContextForTest("acct-1", authSrv.URL)
	insertPairedDeviceWithStableID(t, st, "mobile-1", "Phone", "phone", "stable-mobile-1", time.Now().UTC().Format(time.RFC3339Nano))
	srv := httptest.NewServer(handler)
	defer srv.Close()

	reqBody := `{"clientId":"mobile-1","macAddress":"aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff","broadcastAddress":"8.8.8.8","ports":[53]}`
	req, err := http.NewRequest(http.MethodPost, srv.URL+"/wake/proxy", strings.NewReader(reqBody))
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatalf("new request: %v", err)
	}
	req.Header.Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
	req.Header.Set("Authorization", "Bearer "+fakeAccountJWT(t, "acct-1"))

	resp, err := http.DefaultClient.Do(req)
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatalf("POST /wake/proxy: %v", err)
	}
	defer resp.Body.Close()
	if resp.StatusCode != http.StatusBadRequest {
		t.Fatalf("status=%d, want 400", resp.StatusCode)
	}
}
```

If `SetDesktopAuthContextForTest` does not exist yet, add a tiny test-only helper in the same package as existing account-context tests, or reuse the existing `/account/context` setup path. Do not weaken production authorization for the test.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run tests and verify they fail**
      Run:

  ```bash
  cd services/sidecar-go && go test ./internal/api
  ```

  Expected: FAIL because `/wake/proxy`, request validation, paired-client verification, or the injected sender does not exist.

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement bounded proxy wake handler**

Create `services/sidecar-go/internal/api/handlers_wake.go`. The implementation must:

- Call `authorizePersonalRequest` first.
- Require `clientId` in the JSON body and verify `store.GetPairedDevice(clientId)` exists and is not revoked.
- Validate `macAddress` with `net.ParseMAC`.
- Validate `broadcastAddress` is a private IPv4 subnet broadcast, limited broadcast `255.255.255.255`, or another target already present in the sidecar's own `WakeCapability`. Reject public unicast addresses such as `8.8.8.8`.
- Validate `ports` is non-empty, contains only `7` and/or `9` for the first implementation, and contains no duplicates.
- Send a standard 102-byte magic packet through an injectable sender interface so tests can assert destinations without opening real UDP sockets.
- Log only masked MAC addresses.

Use `strconv.Itoa(port)` when building UDP host/port strings. Do not use `string(port)`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Register route in router.go**
      In `services/sidecar-go/internal/api/router.go`, register:

  ```go
  mux.HandleFunc("POST /wake/proxy", withJSON(srv.handleProxyWake))
  ```

- [ ] **Step 6: Run sidecar API tests**
      Run:

  ```bash
  cd services/sidecar-go && go test ./internal/api
  ```

  Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**
  ```bash
  git add services/sidecar-go/internal/api/router.go services/sidecar-go/internal/api/handlers_wake.go services/sidecar-go/internal/api/router_test.go
  git commit -m "feat: implement sidecar proxy wake endpoint"
  ```

## Task 12: Mobile Client Peer Proxy Orchestration

**Files:**

- Modify: `apps/mobile/ios/SyncEngine/SyncEngineManager.swift`
- Modify: `apps/mobile/android/app/src/main/java/com/vividrop/mobile/china/sync/NativeSyncEngineModule.kt`

- [ ] **Step 1: Gate peer proxy behind multi-desktop peer availability**

Do not run peer proxy for the normal single-bound-desktop case. Before coding orchestration, confirm mobile has a durable source for other desktop bindings or online peer sidecars that are known to be Vivi Drop Desktop sidecars. If the current mobile storage exposes only the active bound desktop, stop this task and split a prerequisite plan for multi-desktop peer discovery/storage.

Do not treat arbitrary router-connected devices as peer proxy candidates. A NAS, OpenWrt box, Home Assistant node, another phone, or any other awake LAN device without Vivi Drop Desktop must be handled only by a separate third-party helper/webhook/router API integration with explicit user configuration and authentication.

- [ ] **Step 2: Orchestrate peer proxy wake in iOS only after direct paths fail**

In `SyncEngineManager.swift`, integrate peer proxy after these higher-priority paths have already been attempted or ruled out:

1. Current reachable LAN `/health`.
2. Direct same-LAN WoL from cached metadata.
3. Existing P2P/direct-route fallback checks that are already active and usable.
4. Configured router Wake-on-WAN/public target, once that follow-up exists.

The peer proxy request must call:

```text
POST http://<peer-lan-host>:39394/wake/proxy
Authorization: Bearer <mobile access token>
Content-Type: application/json
```

with:

```json
{
  "clientId": "<mobile-client-id>",
  "macAddress": "<target-wake-metadata-mac>",
  "broadcastAddress": "<target-wake-metadata-broadcast>",
  "ports": [9]
}
```

If any peer returns `200`, poll the original target desktop `/health`; do not mark the peer host as the target route.

- [ ] **Step 3: Orchestrate peer proxy wake in Android only after direct paths fail**

In `NativeSyncEngineModule.kt`, implement the same ordering and request shape as iOS. Keep the peer proxy attempt bounded to one short pass over currently online peers; do not add another 25-second delay before the existing P2P/relay route can be used.

- [ ] **Step 4: Add diagnostics for skipped peer proxy**

Mobile logs must distinguish:

- `peer proxy skipped reason=no_online_vividrop_desktop_peer`
- `peer proxy skipped reason=no_multi_desktop_binding_source`
- `peer proxy skipped reason=third_party_helper_not_configured`
- `peer proxy request sent host=<peer-host>`
- `peer proxy request rejected status=<status>`
- `peer proxy assisted wake polling target=<target-host>`

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**
  ```bash
  git add apps/mobile/ios/SyncEngine/SyncEngineManager.swift apps/mobile/android/app/src/main/java/com/vividrop/mobile/china/sync/NativeSyncEngineModule.kt
  git commit -m "feat: orchestrate peer proxy wake on mobile"
  ```

## Task 13: Diagnostics, Docs, And Beta Matrix

**Files:**

- Modify: `docs/operations/troubleshooting.md`
- Modify: `docs/operations/mobile-diagnostics.md`
- Modify: `docs/testing/beta-test-matrix.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Add diagnostic log expectations**
      In `docs/operations/mobile-diagnostics.md`, add a "Wake-on-LAN explicit recovery" section:

  ```md
  ### Wake-on-LAN explicit recovery

  When the user opens My Computer or taps Sync Status -> Reconnect on the same LAN/VPN-LAN and the desktop LAN sidecar is unreachable, mobile logs these `Wake` diagnostics:

  - `wake skipped reason=<reason> metadata_missing_or_unusable`: the requested wake path had no cached usable wake targets.
  - `wake skipped reason=<reason> wake_not_attempted_by_policy`: the requested action was outside the allowed wake scope.
  - `wake packets sent packets=<n>`: mobile sent magic packets to directed and limited broadcast destinations.
  - `wake packets sent via peer proxy to host=<peer>`: mobile successfully requested another authenticated, online Vivi Drop desktop sidecar on the same LAN/VPN to send the magic packet.
  - `peer proxy skipped reason=<reason>`: mobile did not find an eligible authenticated awake Vivi Drop Desktop peer, the current build does not have a multi-desktop binding source, or the user has not explicitly configured a third-party helper integration.
  - `desktop woke via host=<ip>`: `/health` became reachable during wake polling.
  - `wake probe timed out`: mobile did not observe sidecar recovery within the bounded polling window.

  These logs do not imply upload queue changes. Wake attempts only affect shared-files route selection or explicit LAN reconnect recovery.
  ```

- [ ] **Step 2: Add troubleshooting guidance**
      In `docs/operations/troubleshooting.md`, add:

  ```md
  ### My Computer or LAN reconnect does not wake after desktop sleep

  Wake-on-LAN is best effort. Check these items before treating it as an app regression:

  - macOS: enable Wake for network access and test on Ethernet when possible.
  - Windows: enable Wake-on-LAN in BIOS/UEFI and NIC power management, including magic-packet wake.
  - Keep phone and desktop on the same LAN. Cross-subnet wake needs router support for directed broadcast, router Wake-on-WAN, or a router/helper that can send WoL inside the LAN.
  - If you have multiple Vivi Drop desktops, Peer Proxy / WOL Relay can help only when another authenticated desktop is awake, online, and reachable on the same LAN/VPN as the sleeping target.
  - Other router-connected devices do not count as peer proxy devices. They can help only if the user explicitly configures a supported router/NAS/helper integration or authenticated webhook.
  - Confirm mobile diagnostics include `wake packets sent` or `wake packets sent via peer proxy`. If metadata is missing, reconnect while the desktop is awake so mobile can cache wake targets.
  - Confirm `/health` reaches `http://<desktop-lan-ip>:39394/health` while the desktop is awake.
  ```

- [ ] **Step 3: Add beta test scenarios**
      In `docs/testing/beta-test-matrix.md`, add rows:

  ```md
  | Shared files wake | macOS sleep -> mobile opens My Computer | Enable Wake for network access, bind mobile, let Mac sleep, open My Computer | Mac wakes or mobile shows unavailable after bounded wake attempt; diagnostics show packets sent and probe result |
  | Shared files wake | Windows sleep -> mobile opens My Computer | Enable BIOS/NIC WoL, bind mobile, let PC sleep, open My Computer | PC wakes or mobile shows unavailable after bounded wake attempt; diagnostics show packets sent and probe result |
  | Router Wake-on-WAN follow-up | mobile outside LAN -> router public wake target configured -> mobile opens My Computer | Configure router directed broadcast/UDP forwarding or router WoL helper before the desktop sleeps | Mobile sends configured public wake target first; diagnostics identify router/public target path before fallback guidance |
  | Peer proxy follow-up | macOS sleep -> mobile has online authenticated Win Vivi Drop desktop peer -> mobile opens My Computer | Windows peer is online on the same LAN/VPN as the Mac, let Mac sleep, open My Computer | Mac wakes via Windows peer proxy only after higher-priority paths are unavailable; diagnostics show proxy wake request sent |
  | Third-party helper follow-up | macOS sleep -> router-connected NAS/OpenWrt/Home Assistant exists but no helper is configured | Keep third-party device awake but do not configure a supported helper/webhook | Mobile does not treat the device as a peer proxy; diagnostics show helper not configured or no eligible Vivi Drop Desktop peer |
  | Sync status LAN reconnect wake | macOS/Windows sleep -> mobile shows offline -> user taps Reconnect | Enable platform WoL settings, bind mobile, let desktop sleep, open Sync Status, tap Reconnect on the same LAN or VPN-LAN | Desktop wakes or mobile remains offline after bounded LAN wake attempt; diagnostics include `lan_reconnect` reason |
  | Passive offline display | macOS/Windows sleep -> mobile app opens and shows offline | Bind mobile, let desktop sleep, open mobile app without tapping Reconnect or My Computer | No wake packets are sent; desktop remains asleep until explicit user action |
  | Shared files wake | Unsupported WoL path | Disable NIC wake or use network that blocks broadcast | Mobile does not hang; existing P2P/direct fallback and unavailable UI remain usable |
  ```

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit docs**
  ```bash
  git add docs/operations/troubleshooting.md docs/operations/mobile-diagnostics.md docs/testing/beta-test-matrix.md
  git commit -m "docs: add explicit wake recovery diagnostics"
  ```

## Task 14: End-To-End Verification

**Files:**

- No new files.

- [ ] **Step 1: Run full sidecar tests**
      Run:

  ```bash
  cd services/sidecar-go
  go test ./...
  ```

  Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 2: Build shared packages**
      Run:

  ```bash
  pnpm build
  ```

  Expected: contracts and design tokens build successfully.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run mobile TypeScript verification**
      Run:

  ```bash
  pnpm --filter @lynavo-drive/mobile exec tsc --noEmit
  ```

  Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run Android verification**
      Run:

  ```bash
  cd apps/mobile/android
  ./gradlew testDebugUnitTest --tests com.vividrop.mobile.china.sync.AndroidSyncPrimitivesTest
  ./gradlew assembleDebug
  ```

  Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run iOS focused verification**
      Run:

  ```bash
  cd apps/mobile/ios/SyncEngine
  swiftc WakeMetadata.swift SyncEngineError.swift WakeOnLanService.swift WakeOnLanServiceTests/main.swift -o /tmp/WakeOnLanServiceTests && /tmp/WakeOnLanServiceTests
  swiftc SharedFilesRoutePolicy.swift SharedFilesRoutePolicyTests/main.swift -o /tmp/SharedFilesRoutePolicyTests && /tmp/SharedFilesRoutePolicyTests
  ```

  Expected: both standalone tests pass. Then run the normal local iOS simulator or archive build used for the target release profile.

- [ ] **Step 6: Manual macOS wake test**
  1. Pair mobile with macOS desktop while both are awake.
  2. Let macOS sleep.
  3. Open mobile `我的電腦`.
  4. Expected: UI shows `正在喚醒我的電腦`, desktop wakes if platform settings allow it, and files load via LAN.

- [ ] **Step 7: Manual Windows wake test**
  1. Enable BIOS/UEFI and NIC magic-packet wake.
  2. Pair mobile with Windows desktop while both are awake.
  3. Let Windows sleep.
  4. Open mobile `我的電腦`.
  5. Expected: UI shows `正在喚醒我的電腦`, Windows wakes if platform settings allow it, and files load via LAN.

- [ ] **Step 8: Manual peer proxy wake test**
  1. Pair mobile with both macOS and Windows desktops.
  2. Let macOS sleep while Windows PC remains awake and online.
  3. Open mobile `我的電腦` for macOS.
  4. Expected: Windows PC sidecar receives proxy wake request, broadcasts standard magic packet, macOS wakes up and becomes available.

- [ ] **Step 9: Pollution review**
- No renderer code directly accesses sidecar, filesystem, or SQLite.
- No upload queue item can be deleted, reordered, skipped, or manually selected by this change.
- No sync state machine transition changes outside shared-files route wake attempts or explicit LAN reconnect wake attempts.
- DTO additions are imported from `@lynavo-drive/contracts` where TypeScript code consumes them.
- Sidecar event names remain dot-notation.
- mDNS TXT records do not contain MAC addresses or wake targets.

- [ ] **Step 10: Final commit**

```bash
git status --short
git log --oneline -10
```

Expected: only intentional implementation commits are present and the worktree is clean except for user-owned unrelated changes.
